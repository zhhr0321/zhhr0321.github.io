title: COCONUT Replication
description: Replicating latent reasoning for LLMs on GSM8k/ProsQA to study token efficiency vs. accuracy.
importance: 3
category: ml
---

Extended the COCONUT latent-reasoning framework in a course project to evaluate how prompting strategies and
beam-search depth affect token efficiency and accuracy on GSM8k and ProsQA. Added instrumentation to better observe
hallucination vs. compute trade-offs when scaling temperature/beam settings.
