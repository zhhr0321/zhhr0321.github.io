# Haoran Zhang (张浩然)

**B.S. Computer Science, University of Michigan**  
**B.S. Mechanical Engineering, UM–SJTU Joint Institute**

I am a senior undergraduate broadly interested in **computer systems, reliability, and large-scale ML infrastructure**.  
Right now I am especially excited about understanding how complex distributed services fail in practice and how to design
runtime systems that keep them reliable and performant.

## Research & Project Interests

- Distributed systems reliability and fail-slow behavior  
- Runtime systems for GPU-based ML workloads  
- Tools for observing, diagnosing, and mitigating production incidents

## Selected Projects

- **Agentic-DS-Ops** – Closed-loop operations framework for ZooKeeper clusters that detects fail-slow overloads and
  applies risk-aware mitigations.  
  _Repo:_ <https://github.com/umich-distsys/agentic-ds-ops>

- **CUDA Graph Runtime (course/research project)** – Hybrid runtime for large-scale ML inference that combines CUDA
  Graphs with persistent kernels to reduce kernel-launch overhead and tail latency.  

- **COCONUT Replication (GSM8k / ProsQA)** – Course project replicating and extending the COCONUT latent-reasoning
  framework on reasoning benchmarks to study token efficiency vs. accuracy trade-offs.
