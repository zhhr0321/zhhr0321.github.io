I am a senior undergraduate double-majoring in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. I enjoy building
and stress-testing computer systems that have to stay reliable under load, especially when they run large-scale ML
workloads. Lately I have been exploring how complex distributed services fail in practice and how runtime systems
can keep them performant.

### Research & project interests
- Distributed systems reliability and fail-slow behavior
- Runtime systems for GPU-heavy ML inference and training
- Tooling for observing, diagnosing, and mitigating production incidents

### Selected projects
- **Agentic-DS-Ops** — Closed-loop operations framework for ZooKeeper clusters that detects fail-slow overloads and applies risk-aware mitigations. [code](https://github.com/umich-distsys/agentic-ds-ops)
- **CUDA Graph Runtime** — Hybrid runtime for large-scale ML inference combining CUDA Graphs with persistent kernels to lower launch overheads and tail latency.
- **COCONUT Replication** — Course project on latent reasoning for LLMs, replicating and extending the COCONUT framework on GSM8k / ProsQA benchmarks.

### Contact
Email is best for anything related to systems reliability, ML infrastructure, or cross CS/ME work. GitHub holds most
code that can be shared publicly.
